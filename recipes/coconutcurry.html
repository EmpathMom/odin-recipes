        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Set a small cast-iron frying skillet over medium-to-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
                <li>Put the coriander seeds, black peppercorns, and fenugreek seeds in the skillet and dry-roast until slightly darker and
                fragrant. Remove the spices from the pan and cool.</li>
                <li>When cooled, grind the roasted spices to a fine powder in a clean, dry coffee or spice grinder. Reserve for later use.</li>
                <li>Pour the ghee into a wide pan and set on medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>When the ghee is hot, add in the black mustard seeds and the cinnamon stick.</li>
                <li>As soon as the mustard seeds start to splutter, add the chicken pieces in a single layer. Be careful of not overcrowding
                the pan.</li>
                <li>Brown the chicken pieces in as many batches as required. Set browned chicken aside.</li>
                <li>Using the same pan in which you cooked the chicken, saut√© the onions and garlic on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Stir often until the onions are light brown.</li>
                <li>If using, add the ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of the turmeric, and tomatoes. Stir and cook until the tomatoes have turned soft
                and mushy.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat and add the roasted spice mixture made earlier. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, the red
                chili powder, salt, and lemon juice. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Remove the thick cream portion from the top of the coconut milk and set aside. Add enough water to the can of coconut
                milk to fill it to the top. Stir the mixture in the can.</li>
                <li>Return the chicken to the pan, pour the water and coconut milk mixture onto the chicken, and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Cover, turn heat to low, and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring every few minutes.</li>
                <li> Stir up the thick coconut cream that was set aside and add to the chicken along with the green chiles.</li>
                <li>Stir a few times, and when the thick coconut cream has warmed through, turn off the heat and serve.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
