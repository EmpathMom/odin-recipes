        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <p>This miso soup recipe is full of savory flavors.
                 Add more dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use
            yellow, white, or red miso paste for this soup â€” yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso is stronger and saltier.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 (2-inch) piece kombu (dried black kelp)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup loosely packed dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi), optional</li>
                <li>4 ounces silken or firm tofu, drained</li>
                <li>1 to 2 medium scallions</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons red or white miso paste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup Olive oil, extra-virgin</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ol>
                <li>Make the dashi (See step-by-step instructions: How To Make Dashi). Combine the water and kombu in a 1-quart saucepan
                over medium heat. Remove the kombu just as the water starts to come to a boil. Add the bonito flakes, if using, and let
                the water come to a rapid simmer. Simmer for about 1 minute, then remove the pan from heat and let the bonito steep for
                an additional 5 minutes. Strain the bonito from the dashi. Add additional water if necessary to make 2 cups.
                Alternatively, substitute 2 cups water, chicken broth, or vegetable broth.</li>
                <li>Prepare the tofu and scallions. Cut the tofu into very small cubes, 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch on each side. Slice the
                scallions very thinly. </li>
                <li>Bring the broth to a rapid simmer. Pour the dashi or broth back into the saucepan and bring to a rapid simmer over
                medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Mix the miso with 1/2 cup hot broth. Place the miso in a small ramekin or measuring cup. Scoop out about 1/2 cup of the
                broth and pour it over the miso. Whisk with a fork or whisk until the miso is entirely dissolved in the water and no
                lumps remain.</li>
                <li>Pour the miso into the broth. Pour the dissolved miso into the simmering broth.</li>
                <li>Add the tofu. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the tofu to the miso. Simmer just enough to warm the tofu, 1 to 2
                minutes. Do not boil the miso once the tofu has been added.</li>
                <li>Add the scallions. Just before serving, scatter the scallions over the top of the soup.</li>
                <li>Serve in individual bowls. Pour the miso into individual bowls and serve. Miso is best when served fresh. It will settle
                a bit as it sits in the broth; whisk briefly with chopsticks or a spoon to mix the soup again.</li>
